3. **Export Type Selection**: Choose which CSV types to download (all selected by default)
4. **Download Process**: Real-time progress with status updates
5. **Completion**: Files organized automatically, recent downloads updated

### Behind the Scenes:
1. **Authentication Check**: Verifies if you're already logged in

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Flask Web Application**: Modern, responsive user interface
- **Browser Automation**: Handles login and session management using Playwright
- **API Integration**: Communicates with Pakaneo's internal APIs using aiohttp
- **Concurrent Processing**: Downloads multiple files simultaneously with semaphore control
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry system with comprehensive error handling

### Security Features
- Credentials stored locally in encrypted environment files
- Session data cached securely for reuse
- No sensitive data transmitted to external servers
- Browser automation runs in isolated profile

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication failed"**
- Check your email/password in `.env` file
- Verify the Pakaneo URL is correct
- Try deleting `auth_details.json` to force fresh login

**"No data found"**
- Verify customer IDs are valid and have access to billing data
- Check if date range contains actual data
- Ensure you have proper permissions in Pakaneo

**"Download failed"**
- Check internet connection stability
- System will automatically retry failed downloads
- Check logs in `logs/General_Logs/` for detailed error information

**Web interface won't open**
- Ensure no other application is using port 5000
- Try running `python app.py` directly to see error messages
- Check if virtual environment is properly activated

### Logs and Debugging
Detailed logs are saved in `logs/General_Logs/` for troubleshooting:
- `main.log`: Overall process logs
- `automation.log`: CSV download process details
- `bot.log`: Browser automation and authentication logs
- `helpers.log`: Utility function logs

### Getting Help
1. Check the logs in `logs/General_Logs/` for error details
2. Verify your `.env` file has correct credentials
3. Ensure customer IDs exist and have data for the selected date range
4. Try running with a single customer first to isolate issues
